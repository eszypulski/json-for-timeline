William Apess delivers a public rebuke of white moral hypocrisy on stage in Boston. Apess framed his lecture as a eulogy of King Philip (Metacom), the Wampanoag leader who led his people in a violent resistance of colonial oppression over 160 years prior. Due to its popular reception, Apess delivered the lecture one additional time at the Odeon, and had it published the following year.  </p>"
